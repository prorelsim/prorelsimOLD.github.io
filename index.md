# [](#header-1)Promotion & Relegation Simulation For US Soccer.

This project aims to create a statistical model of a US soccer promotion & relegation pyramid structure. 

#### [](#header-4)What Is Promotion & Relegation?
*Promotion and relegation is a process where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance for the completed season. The best-ranked team(s) in the lower division are promoted to the higher division for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the higher division are relegated to the lower division for the next season.* [read more here...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation)

#### [](#header-4)Why?
There is now a growing interest in soccer at grassroots level in the US. Several amateur soccer clubs have already been setup and are being run successfully. In a promotion & relegation system, an amateur soccer club, could in theory, enter the lowest league in the soccer pryamid, gain promotion each season and eventually reach the top league in the country. It could then compete in continetal cups similar to the Champions League/UEFA Europa League in Europe and the Copa Liberatores in South America. The US is one of only three countries in the world that don't use promotion & relegation. Canada and Australia being the other two. Under the current system, a soccer club would need to be invited to play in the top league. 

#### [](#header-4)Assumptions

*   that soccer can be the number one sport in the US.
*   that soccer could compete with other sports for talented athletes.
*   there are sponsors who wish to be involved in soccer

#### [](#header-4)Statistical Model Of A Soccer Club

##### [](#header-5)Owners
*   company/s
*   individual/s
*   combination of above

##### [](#header-5)Staff
*   manager
*   coach
*   scout
*   physio
*   other staff

##### [](#header-5)Income
*   cash injection from owner/bank
*   ticket sales
*   merchandise
*   player sales
*   league prize winnings=20

##### [](#header-5)Costs
*   loan repayments to owner/bank
*   player salaries
*   stadium costs
*   staff salaries

#### [](#header-4)League structure
*   semi-pro and amateur leagues organised on a regional basis.
*   one or more state wide professional leagues
*   one or more nation wide professional leagues

#### [](#header-4)Actions
One or more people or organisations invest/buy/setup a soccer club. They hire, buy or build a stadium, training facility, administrative headquarters and a youth academy. They hire managers, coaches, physios as well as administrative staff for general day to day running and commercial activities. They build up a roster of players by using their financial resources to sign the best players they can. They enter the soccer pyramid at the lowest level. Each season they improve their facilities, players & coaches. They gain promotion and with it higher commercial income, better chance of signing a higher calibre of player, more awareness about their club on a local, regional, state level. They suffer relegation and with it the inverse if promotion benefits.

#### [](#header-4)Competent Actions
Developing your own players, investing in your scouting networks, hiring competent coaches and managers, managing your finances responsibly, signing and loaning good players, selling home grown players for a profit and being able to replace them.

#### [](#header-4)Transfer Market
An active transfer market both internally within the US and externally with other clubs around the world. 
Players would move to another club if...

- they can offer them a higher salary
- they can offer them a longer length contract
- they play in a more competitive league 
- they play in continetal competitions
- their chance of playing for the US national team would increase
	
#### [](#header-4)Bankruptcy/Insolvency
This is a reality of promotion & relegation systems and will be included. It will be assumed that this is down to mismanaged club resources and irresponsible management. Rather than the existence of relegation itself. Effects of relegation will be inverse to promotions. Income from ticket sales, TV coverage and merchandise will decrease as less people will want to watch lower calibre opposition or wish to travel to lower standard away stadiums. Players will seek transfers to play at higher leagues there by weakening the team the club can field. Some players may refuse to be transfered and this will affect the clubs finances as it will not be able to reduce its salary bill to match the income it recives from being in a lower league.

#### [](#header-4)Travel Cost
Vast distances involved would require subsidised travel. The soccer association that governs the soccer prymid would subsidise costs. Only a professional soccer could afford to travel across the US for a soccer match. Take for example LA based club playing a match against a New York based club. [Research flight costs.]

#### [](#header-4)Travel Distance
The impact on a players performance to fly say 5 hours from LA to New York would need to be taken into account. It would not make senses for amateur or semi pro teams to travel such distance. As such they would be organised into regional leagues. For professional leagues perhaps the fixture list could take into account distances and schedule long distance matches only after a certain number of short distance matches. But the nature of promotion relegation is that the teams in a league is determined by strength of team. For example you could have a situation where half the teams in the league are from the west coast while the other half are from the east coast.

#### [](#header-4)Youth teams
Youth teams would play in local leagues based on a regional or state wide distribution. National youth leagues may not be feasible but one off youth tournaments where the nations best youth teams meet would be or already is a reality.

#### [](#header-4)High School/College/Pro League Route
It is assumed that clubs will try to recruit players as early as they can. The traditional route to a professional sports career of college first will probably not be preferred by either club or player. Players will be signed to a club professionally at 18. Players will have some connection to a club at some level in the soccer pyramid by age 12 either by local junior teams or academy's.

#### [](#header-4)Salary
Salary data will be used from soccer clubs in Europe that are based in comparable sized cities and comparable income levels.

#### [](#header-4)Clubs
For example In London, UK, there are many clubs of differing size and income levels. A comparable city in the US would be New York or LA. So you would expect there to be a similar spread and distribution of clubs. Leyton Orient, Brentford, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Charlton, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal.

The starting resources of each soccer club will be based on population size and income levels of the city it is based in.

Outliers like Villarreal in Spain(city of 40,000) who have consistently played in the Spanish top league can be modelled by adding committed long term wealth backers and a well managed club(scouting and hiring suitable managers and players).

#### [](#header-4)Super Clubs 
Super Club is defined as one whose revenue is in the top 10 in the world. For example Real Madrid,Barcelona,Bayern,Manchester United. How and where and if one or more US super clubs would develop.

#### [](#header-4)Competent Actions

Each city or town will have at least one soccer team.
